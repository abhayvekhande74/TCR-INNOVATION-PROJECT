<body><h1>FARMERS FORUM     <br> 
TOWARDS THE DIGITAL FARMING <h1>

<p1>Online farmers forum - a streamlined, single point of online access to agricultural programs and information starting from the grassroot level aims at educating Indian farmers by transferring research-derived knowledge and assisting them by providing information such as crop bulletins,planting and harvesting dates to assist producers in planning and managing the production of their crops. <p1>
<br>
<br>
<p2>We also provide recent information on prices, volume, quality, condition and other market data on domestic crops. In addition, we analyse data to create comprehensive reports outlining crop yields, crop weather requirements, areas harvested and other production information. We also provide unbiased price and sales information to assist in the orderly marketing and distribution of farm commodities. <p2>
<br>
<br>
<p3>Our goal is to reach out to the Indian farmers and provide them with the necessary information required for crop production and this website is an attempt at fulfilling that.<p3>
